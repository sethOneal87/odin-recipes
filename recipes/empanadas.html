    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir 
            until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 
            minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, saz√≥n, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce 
            the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <p><li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until &frac12; inch large in diameter.
            Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk.  Moisten the disk edges with 
            water, fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal(or seal with a fork).</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large suacepan to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).
            Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to paper
           towels to drain.</li></p>
    </ol>

    <h1>La Cocina Goya Cooking Tip</h1>

    <p>Crispy empanadas, guaranteed! If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer, you can still estimate the temperature of the oil. 
        Just place the handle of your wooden spoon (or a wooden chopstick) into the oil. If a steady stream of bubbles emerges from the wood, 
        the oil is perfect. If the oil starts rapidly bubbling, or if only a few bubbles are present, then the oil is too hot or too cold, respectively.</p>
