        <li>1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cups finely chopped onion, divided</li>
        <li>&frac23; cup orange juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 pounds skinless,boneless chicken thighs, cut in half</li>
        <li>8 (12-inch) jumbo wooden skewers</li>
        <li>1 large fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
        <li>20 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add dried chiles; cook, 
           turning occasionally, until toasted and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes.
           Add 1 cup water to just cover the chiles, and bring to a simmer over medium-high. 
           Cover and cook, undisturbed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.</li></p>
        <p><li>Combine chiles, achiote, garlic, chipotles, &frac23; cup onion, orange juice,
            vinegar, oil, cumin, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; process until smooth, about
            30 seconds. Reserve &frac12; cup marinade, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</li></p>
        <p><li>Place remaining marinade in a shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag, add chicken; 
            toss to evenly coat. Cover chicken with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or up 
            to 24 hours.</li></p>
        <p><li>Place wooden skewers in a shallow dish; cover with water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature 
            while chicken marinates.</li></p>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Position oven rack 8 inches away from heating element. 
            Line a small roasting pan or 13- x 9-inch baking dish with aluminum foil.</li></p>
        <p><li>Thread 1 pineapple slice onto 2 skewers, being sure to pierce through the center core, (skewers will be 
            about 1 inch apart), leaving a 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>- inch space from end of skewer.
            Thread 5 to 6 pieces of marinated chicken, stacking on top of pineapple; thread 1 pineapple slice. Repeat
            process, ending with pineapple slice, until all chicken pieces and pienapple slices are used, making 5 stacks total.
            Brush with any remaining marinade from chicken.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Place stacked skewers in the prepared pan, resting skewer ends on edge of pan so that the chicken doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Flip skewers over, brush with reserved &frac12; cup marinade. Bake until
            chicken is no longer pink in the center and the jices run clear, about 30 minutes longer. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Increase oven temperature to 
            broil; broil until browned and cripsy, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and broil until browned and cripsy, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over high heat. Working two at a time, add tortillas; cook, turning once, until heated and browning in some spots, 
            1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li></p>
        <p><li>Remove chicken and pineapple from skewers, place on cutting board, roughly chop.</li></p>
         <p><li>Divide chicken and pineapple between heated tortillas; top with remaingn onion and cilantro.</li></p>
